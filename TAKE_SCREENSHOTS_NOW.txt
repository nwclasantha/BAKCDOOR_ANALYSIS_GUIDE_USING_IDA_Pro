          HOW TO TAKE SCREENSHOTS - DO THIS NOW
              (Since I Cannot Do It For You)
================================================================================

I understand you want screenshots, but I CANNOT run IDA Pro or capture your
screen. This is a technical limitation - I can only run command-line tools.

However, I CAN guide you to take them yourself! It's EASY - just follow below:

================================================================================
STEP 1: LAUNCH IDA PRO WITH THE BACKDOOR
================================================================================

Option A: Use My Script (Easiest)
----------------------------------
1. Double-click: launch_ida.bat
2. IDA Pro will open automatically with the backdoor loaded
3. Skip to STEP 2

Option B: Manual Launch
-----------------------
1. Go to: D:\Forensics\
2. Double-click: ida.exe (or ida64.exe)
3. Click: File → Open
4. Browse to: C:\Users\nwcla\Desktop\IDA-Py\
5. Select: simple_backdoor_debug.exe
6. Click: OK
7. Wait for analysis to complete (watch progress bar)

================================================================================
STEP 2: TAKE YOUR FIRST SCREENSHOT
================================================================================

Let's practice with the main interface:

1. Make sure IDA Pro window is visible
2. Press: Windows Key + Shift + S
3. Your screen will dim
4. Click and drag to select the IDA Pro window
5. Screenshot is copied to clipboard!
6. Open Paint or Word
7. Press: Ctrl+V (paste)
8. Save as: 01_IDA_Main_Interface.png

DONE! You just took your first screenshot!

================================================================================
STEP 3: TAKE THE REMAINING 15 SCREENSHOTS
================================================================================

Now follow SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md - it tells you exactly:
- What button to press in IDA Pro
- What window will open
- What to capture
- What to name the file

Here's the quick list:

Screenshot 2: Imports Window
   → Press Ctrl+I
   → Capture the Imports window
   → Save as: 02_Imports_Window.png

Screenshot 3: Strings Window
   → Press Shift+F12
   → Capture the Strings window
   → Save as: 03_Strings_Window.png

Screenshot 4: Functions List
   → Press Shift+F3
   → Capture the Functions window
   → Save as: 04_Functions_List.png

Screenshot 5: Graph View
   → Double-click "establish_connection" in Functions window
   → Press Spacebar
   → Press - (minus) to zoom out
   → Capture the graph
   → Save as: 05_Graph_View_Overview.png

Screenshot 6-12: Various blocks in graph view
   → Follow SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md for details

Screenshot 13: Cross-references
   → Navigate to _popen
   → Press X
   → Capture
   → Save as: 13_Cross_References.png

Screenshot 14-16: Additional views
   → Follow SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md

================================================================================
STEP 4: CREATE A SCREENSHOTS FOLDER
================================================================================

1. In: C:\Users\nwcla\Desktop\IDA-Py\
2. Create new folder: "screenshots"
3. Save all your screenshots there

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE - KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
================================================================================

While in IDA Pro:

Ctrl+I          = Open Imports window
Shift+F12       = Open Strings window
Shift+F3        = Open Functions window
Spacebar        = Toggle Text/Graph view
X               = Cross-references
-               = Zoom out (in graph view)
+               = Zoom in (in graph view)

To take screenshot:
Windows+Shift+S = Snipping tool (select area)
Print Screen    = Full screen screenshot

================================================================================
WHY I CAN'T DO THIS FOR YOU
================================================================================

Even though you gave me permission, I have technical limitations:

❌ I cannot launch GUI applications (IDA Pro, Paint, Word, etc.)
❌ I cannot see your screen
❌ I cannot click buttons or use mouse
❌ I cannot take screenshots

✅ I CAN run command-line tools (gcc, git, dir, etc.)
✅ I CAN create files and scripts for you
✅ I CAN give you detailed instructions

Think of me as a command-line assistant - I work in text, not graphics!

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: SAMPLE SCREENSHOTS
================================================================================

If you want example screenshots to see what they should look like:

1. Search Google Images for: "IDA Pro imports window"
2. Search: "IDA Pro graph view backdoor"
3. Search: "IDA Pro strings window malware"

These will show you examples of what your screenshots should look like.

================================================================================
TIME REQUIRED
================================================================================

Taking all 16 screenshots: 30-45 minutes

If you're short on time, prioritize these 5:
1. Screenshot 2: Imports (Ctrl+I)
2. Screenshot 3: Strings (Shift+F12)
3. Screenshot 5: Graph overview
4. Screenshot 8: Connect block
5. Screenshot 11: _popen block

These 5 alone will make your guide very effective!

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS - DO THIS NOW
================================================================================

1. ✅ Double-click: launch_ida.bat
   (This will open IDA Pro with the backdoor)

2. ✅ Practice taking one screenshot:
   - Press Windows+Shift+S
   - Select area
   - Paste in Paint (Ctrl+V)
   - Save

3. ✅ Follow SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md for all 16 screenshots

4. ✅ Save all screenshots to: screenshots\ folder

5. ✅ Add screenshots to your DOCX document
