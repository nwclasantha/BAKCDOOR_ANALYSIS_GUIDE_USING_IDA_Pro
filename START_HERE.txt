                Educational Backdoor Analysis Package
                    For MSc Cybersecurity Students
================================================================================

CONGRATULATIONS! Your complete educational malware analysis package is ready!

================================================================================
WHAT YOU HAVE NOW
================================================================================

I've created a comprehensive package for teaching your MSc students how to
detect and analyze backdoors using IDA Pro. Everything is ready to use!

📁 LOCATION: C:\Users\nwcla\Desktop\IDA-Py\

================================================================================
STEP 1: COMPILE THE BACKDOOR (DO THIS FIRST!)
================================================================================

The source code is ready, but you need to compile it to create the .exe files.

🔧 EASY METHOD (Recommended):
   1. Double-click: compile.bat
   2. Wait for compilation to finish
   3. Press any key when done

This will create:
   • simple_backdoor.exe (standard version)
   • simple_backdoor_debug.exe (with debug symbols - BEST for teaching)
   • simple_backdoor_release.exe (stripped, realistic)

✅ VERIFY: After running compile.bat, you should see three .exe files

================================================================================
STEP 2: TEST WITH IDA PRO
================================================================================

Before your class:

1. Open IDA Pro from: D:\Forensics\
2. Load: simple_backdoor_debug.exe
3. Wait for analysis to complete
4. Test the shortcuts:
   • Press Ctrl+I (Imports window)
   • Press Shift+F12 (Strings window)
   • Press Shift+F3 (Functions window)
   • Navigate to establish_connection and press Space (Graph view)

================================================================================
STEP 3: PREPARE YOUR DEMONSTRATION
================================================================================

Use this file for your live demonstration:
📄 IDA_DEMO_STEPS.txt (61 KB) ← THE COMPLETE STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE!

This file contains:
   ✓ Complete demonstration script with instructor notes
   ✓ Exact steps to follow on screen
   ✓ What to say to students
   ✓ Expected student responses
   ✓ Screenshots descriptions
   ✓ Timing for each section (2-hour lab)
   ✓ Student exercises
   ✓ Q&A talking points

Just follow it section by section during your class!

================================================================================
STEP 4: PRINT STUDENT MATERIALS
================================================================================

Print one copy per student:
📄 STUDENT_HANDOUT.md (13 KB)

This is a fill-in-the-blank worksheet with:
   • Learning objectives
   • Step-by-step exercises
   • Questions to answer
   • IOC creation templates
   • YARA rule creation guide
   • Assessment questions

================================================================================
QUICK START TIMELINE
================================================================================

BEFORE CLASS (30 minutes):
--------------------------
☐ Double-click compile.bat to create .exe files
☐ Test open simple_backdoor_debug.exe in IDA Pro (D:\Forensics\)
☐ Print STUDENT_HANDOUT.md for each student
☐ Copy .exe files to student machines
☐ Review IDA_DEMO_STEPS.txt

DURING CLASS (2 hours):
-----------------------
Hour 1:
   00-15 min: Introduction + IDA Pro interface
   15-30 min: Import analysis demo (Ctrl+I)
   30-45 min: String analysis demo (Shift+F12)
   45-60 min: Function list and graph view basics

Hour 2:
   60-80 min: Deep dive into establish_connection function
   80-90 min: Cross-references and YARA rules
   90-120 min: Student hands-on exercises

AFTER CLASS:
------------
☐ Collect student worksheets
☐ Grade lab reports (rubric in README_INSTRUCTOR.md)
☐ Securely delete malware samples from student machines

================================================================================
TEACHING TIPS
================================================================================

✓ Use IDA_DEMO_STEPS.txt as your script - it tells you exactly what to say!
✓ Go slowly - IDA Pro interface can be overwhelming at first
✓ Use a projector - students need to SEE the analysis
✓ Ask questions frequently to keep students engaged
✓ Let students explore - mistakes are learning opportunities
✓ The most important demo is Section 6 (Graph View Analysis)
✓ Emphasize the "combination is key" concept (network + execution = backdoor)

================================================================================
KEY LEARNING POINTS FOR STUDENTS
================================================================================

By the end of this lab, students should understand:

1. How to navigate IDA Pro interface
2. How to identify suspicious imports (network + execution combination)
3. How to find IOCs in strings
4. How to use graph view to visualize malicious behavior
5. What a reverse shell is and how it works
6. How to create YARA rules for detection
7. The importance of following data flow (recv → _popen)

================================================================================
WHAT THE BACKDOOR DOES (Technical Summary)
================================================================================

Type: Reverse Shell Backdoor

Behavior:
1. Obfuscates target IP address using XOR encryption
2. Connects to 127.0.0.1:4444 (localhost for safety)
3. Receives commands from "attacker"
4. Executes commands using _popen()
5. Sends results back
6. Repeats in infinite loop until "exit" command

Detection Points:
• Combination of WSAStartup, socket, connect (networking)
• Combined with _popen (command execution)
• No input validation between network input and execution
• Suspicious function names: establish_connection, decode_string
• XOR decoding loop (obfuscation)

Severity: CRITICAL (provides full remote command execution)

================================================================================
SAFETY REMINDERS ⚠️
================================================================================

⚠️ This is REAL malware created for educational purposes!

ALWAYS:
✓ Use isolated lab network (no internet)
✓ Use virtual machines
✓ Supervise all student activities
✓ Collect and delete samples after class

NEVER:
✗ Run on production systems
✗ Connect to the internet while malware is present
✗ Allow students to take samples outside the lab
✗ Use without proper authorization

The backdoor is designed to connect to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) for safety,
but it's still malware and should be treated as such!

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: compile.bat doesn't work or .exe files not created
SOLUTION:
   • Open Command Prompt in this folder
   • Run: gcc --version (check if GCC is installed)
   • Run: gcc simple_backdoor.c -o simple_backdoor.exe -lws2_32
   • If errors appear, check COMPILE_INSTRUCTIONS.md

PROBLEM: IDA Pro can't open the .exe file
SOLUTION:
   • Try simple_backdoor_debug.exe instead
   • Disable antivirus temporarily
   • Run IDA Pro as Administrator
   • Make sure IDA Pro is at: D:\Forensics\

PROBLEM: Students can't find functions in IDA Pro
SOLUTION:
   • Wait for auto-analysis to complete (progress bar at bottom)
   • Analysis → Reanalyze Program
   • Use Shift+F3 to open Functions window

PROBLEM: Graph view is too small/hard to read
SOLUTION:
   • Press '-' (minus key) to zoom out and fit window
   • Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
   • Use middle mouse button to pan around

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS - RIGHT NOW!
================================================================================

1. ✅ Double-click compile.bat (creates the .exe files)

2. ✅ Open IDA Pro (D:\Forensics\) and load simple_backdoor_debug.exe
      to test it works

3. ✅ Open IDA_DEMO_STEPS.txt and read through it
      (this is your complete teaching script!)

4. ✅ Print STUDENT_HANDOUT.md for your students
